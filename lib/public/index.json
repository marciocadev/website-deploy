To avoid using the main account, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to create an alternative user with access to the necessary resources\nIn our case, we can list specific resources, but since the goal is to study AWS resources, I created a new user with administrative resources\nOnce logged into the main account, search for Identity Access Management (IAM) to create the new user Create a new user # Give your user a name and check the option Provide user access to the AWS Management Console - optional so the user can log into the AWS console In my specific case, I want to create a user with which I can deploy resources from my personal machine with IaC (Infrastructure as Code), so I checked the AdministratorAccess policy Create the user by selecting the Create User button After creating the user, you can retrieve the temporary password Get the Access Key # Once your user has been created, select the user and the Access Key field on the screen Select the Command Line Interface (CLI) option and download the csv file or copy the access key. This information will be necessary for configuring AWS credentials in your development environment First Login # First Login Once the user has been created, make the first access and generate the new password\nConfigure the local environment # Once you\u0026rsquo;ve created the new user and obtained the access key, we can then create the necessary files for the local environment\nLinux / macOS Windows mkdir ~/.aws cd ~/.aws echo [default] \u0026gt; credentials echo aws_access_key_id=\u0026lt;access key\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; credentials echo aws_secret_access_key=\u0026lt;access secret\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; credentials echo [default] \u0026gt; config echo region=us-east-1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config echo output=json \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config mkdir C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.aws cd C:\\Users\\USERNAME\\.aws echo [default] \u0026gt; credentials echo aws_access_key_id=\u0026lt;access key\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; credentials echo aws_secret_access_key=\u0026lt;access secret\u0026gt; \u0026gt;\u0026gt; credentials echo [default] \u0026gt; config echo region=us-east-1 \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config echo output=json \u0026gt;\u0026gt; config ","date":"January 05, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tutorials/aws/config/","section":"Tutorials","summary":"","title":"Configuring your AWS environment","type":"tutorials"},{"content":"","date":"January 05, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Marcio Cruz de Almeida","summary":"","title":"Marcio Cruz de Almeida","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"January 05, 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" List of projects developed and lessons learned in the use of technologies and their applications.
